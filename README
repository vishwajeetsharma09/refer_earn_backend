*** ( How to Check Stored Data in MySQL Database ) ****

1) So before checking Referral info and its data  we need to start the server 
2) For starting the server we need to open this folder in terminal  = refer-earn\backend> and then write there command 
           ******************** ( npm start) ************
3) once you will write this npm start command our app server will be start and you can see message = Server is running on port 5000

4) Once backend server will get started then you also need to start frontend (for that follow frontend readme file)

5) now when both frontend and backend will start then you can see the refernow button on browser frontend there you need to enter all the info of person you want to refer 

6) After writing information click on send button then by this refferal will sent to target email and data will also gets stored in our MYSQL database  (Now below how to access Data of refferal) ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡



NOW HOW TO CHECK REFFERAL DATA INFO 

1) Don't close backend server keep it running just open new termial and again open same path = refer-earn\backend> and after opening this path enter this command = (  mysql -u root -p  )

2) once you will write this command mysql -u root -p then it will ask for passowrd for Your Database and password is nik@123N (created this just for project testing purpose )

3) after above step you can see all the databases there and their info then to check referral data write this command =                                          (  USE refer_earn;  )

4) DESCRIBE referral;
5) SELECT * FROM referral;

4) after using you can easily see all the successful referral data there 

5) AND THIS IS HOW YOU CAN SUCCESSFULY SEE DATA OF REFFERAL WHICH ALL IS DONE BY HELP OF ( MYSQL AND PRISMA ORM ) CONNECTION
